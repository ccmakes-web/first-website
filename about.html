    <h1 class="BL-Title"> Bobbin Lace </h1>

    <h5 class="BL-Title">This is a craft that I have always wanted to try; once I started, I found it enjoyable and easy to learn.  The next step is to develop an understanding of the various types of bobbin lace and the patterns that can be created using the two weaving actions of "cross" and "twist" used to create lace.</h5>

    <h2> First Steps </h2>

        <aside class="bl-intro"> <p>I started with a House of Crafts, Lacemaking Kit.  This is a basic kit with plastic bobbins. I worked my way through each of the sample patterns, also included in the kit were the threads and polystyrene roller as the lace pillow.<br> <br>As I enjoyed making these lace patterns and quickly picked up the basic steps to bobbin lace, I decided to go ahead and purchase wooden bobbins and the cookie pillow; a name for the pillow used in lace making.</p>

    <div class="nx-steps">

        <h2> Next Steps </h2>

        <p class="torchon">Using a book called "A Beginners Guide to Bobbin Lace Making"  I traced the patterns I wanted to make.  I decided upon bookmarks of varying styles.  A cloth stich bookworm and a half stitch bookworm each included beads for eyes. A torchon ground bookmark as per the image below and other styles which were given as gifts.</p>

        <h2 class="h-spmat"> Spiral Lace Mat </h2>

        <p class="bl-spmat">Following the purchase of several secondhand books from eBay and looking through the designs and patterns, I decided to make the "Spiral Lace Mat".  As the tape style of lace, would be an easy pattern to follow and would not take too long to complete as a first large project.</p>

        <img class="sp1" src="images\bobbin lace\spiral-mat\Optimized-img1-BL-spriral-mat.jpg" alt="image of bobbin lace making book by, Pamela Nottingham" height="300px" width="">

        <img class="sp2" src="images\bobbin lace\spiral-mat\Optimized-img2-BL-spiral-mat.jpg" alt="image of spiral mat and bobbin lace pattern to trace" height="200px" width="">
        
        <p class="bl-spmat2"> To get a copy of the pattern tracing, I scanned and printed out the image then laid over a blue transfer film. This film makes the image clearer to see and enables the pattern to stand up to the pricking out of the pattern and the pattern can be used again until worn out.  The lace pins are placed in the pricked-out holes as you weave the bobbins.<p>

        <img class="sp3" src="images\bobbin lace\spiral-mat\Optimized-img3a-BL-spiral-mat.jpg" alt="image of traced spiral mat pricked out and bobbins wound with thread" height="300px" width="">

        <p class="bl-spmat3"> Once the tracing was pricked and pinned on to the pillow, protection cloths were laid down to cover the pins in each corner of the tracing to stop the thread from snagging and to prevent dirt or dust transferring on to the lace being woven.  The cloths are also laid over the lace when putting the work away.</p>

        <p class="bl-spmat-end"> hen the work was completed on the pillow, you must cut the threads leaving a tail of approx. 4 inches to then fasten off and weaving into the work gradually.  Typically, in bobbin lace the underside of the work is considered to be the right side.</p> 
        <h5>Finally, the Spiral Mat was mounted to a piece of felt and mounted in a box frame.</h5>
