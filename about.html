    <h1 class="BL-Title"> Bobbin Lace </h1>

    <h5 class="BL-Title">This is a craft that I have always wanted to try; once I started, I found it enjoyable and easy to learn.  The next step is to develope an understanding of the various types of bobbin lace and the patterns that can be created using the two weaving actions of "cross" and "twist" used in creating lace.</h5>

    <h2> First Steps </h2>

        <aside class="bl-intro"> <p>I started with a House of Crafts, Lacemaking Kit.  This is a basic kit with plastic lace bobbins.  I worked my way though each of the sample patterns included in the kit along with the threads and using the small, enclosed polystyrene roller as the lace pillow.<br> <br>As I enjoyed this and picked up the basic steps to bobbin lace, I decided to go ahead and purchase wooden bobbins and the cookie pillow; a name for the pillow used in lace making.</p>

        <h2> Next Steps </h2>

        <p class="torchon">Using a book called "A Beginners Guide to Bobbin Lace Making" and following tracing the patterns made bookmarks of varing styles including the addition of beads.</p>

        <h2 class="h-spmat"> Spiral Lace Mat </h2>

        <p class="bl-spmat">Following the purchase of several secondhand books from ebay and looking through the designs and patterns, I decided to make the "Spiral Lace Mat" as this style is tape lace and would be easier and quicker to complete for as a  first large project.</p>

        <img class="sp1" src="images\bobbin lace\spiral-mat\Optimized-img1-BL-spriral-mat.jpg" alt="image of bobbin lace making book by, Pamela Nottingham" height="300px" width="">

        <img class="sp2" src="images\bobbin lace\spiral-mat\Optimized-img2-BL-spiral-mat.jpg" alt="image of spiral mat and bobbin lace pattern to trace" height="200px" width="">
        
        <p class="bl-spmat2"> To get a copy of the tracing I scanned and printed out the image, then layover a blue transfer film.  This makes the image clearer to see and stands up to the pricking out of the pattern, this is where the pins are placed as you weave the bobbins. <p>

        <img class="sp3" src="images\bobbin lace\spiral-mat\Optimized-img3a-BL-spiral-mat.jpg" alt="image of traced spiral mat pricking and bobbins wound with thread" height="300px" width="">

        <p class="bl-spmat3"> Once the tracing was pricked and pinned on to the cookie pillow, protection cloths were laid down to cover the pins in each corner of the tracing to stop the thread from snagging and to prevent  dirt or dust transfering on to the lace being woven.</p>

        <img class="sp5" src="images\bobbin lace\spiral-mat\Optimized-img4a-spiral-mat.jpg" alt="image of traced spiral mat pricking and bobbins wound with thread" height="300px" width="">

        <p class="bl-spmat-end">Once the tape lace was completed, it must rest on the cookie pillow for 24 hours to allow the fibers within the thread to relax and form its shape.  If removed too early the edges can distort.</p> <h5>Finally the Spiral Mat was mounted on to felt and mounted in a box frame.</h5>
